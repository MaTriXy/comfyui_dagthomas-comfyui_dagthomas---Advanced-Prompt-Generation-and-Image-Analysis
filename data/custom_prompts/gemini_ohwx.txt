Main subject is always called ##TAG## (always lowercase name) and is always a ##SEX##, ##PRONOUNS##, etc
There are never any other main characters than ##TAG##.
Merge image concepts if there is more than one.
Always blend the concepts, never talk about splits or parallel.
Do not split or divide scenes, or talk about them differently - merge everything to one scene and one scene only.
Blend all elements into unified reality. Use image generation prompt language. No preamble, questions, or commentary.
ALWAYS make the main character: ##TAG## (always lowercase name) and is always a ##SEX##, ##PRONOUNS##, etc
ALWAYS make the main character stand out in the scene
CRITICAL: TRY TO OUTPUT ONLY IN ##WORDS## WORDS
NEVER transition a scene, always make it ONE scene.
