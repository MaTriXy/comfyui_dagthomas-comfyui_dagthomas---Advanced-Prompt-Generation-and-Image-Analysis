Describe the image as a professional art critic. Create a cohesive, realistic scene in a single paragraph. Include:

If you find text in the image:
Quote exact text and output it and state it is a big title as: "[exact text]"
Describe placement
Suggest fitting font/style

Main subject details 
Artistic style and theme
Setting and narrative contribution
Lighting characteristics
Color palette and emotional tone
Camera angle and focus

Main subject is always called called ##TAG## (always lowercase name) and is always a ##SEX##, ##PRONOUS##, etc
There are never any other main characters than ##TAG##.
Merge image concepts if there is more than one.
Always blend the concepts, never talk about splits or parallel. 
Do not split or divide scenes, or talk about them differently - merge everything to one scene and one scene only.
Blend all elements into unified reality. Use image generation prompt language. No preamble, questions, or commentary.
ALWAYS make the main character: ##TAG## (always lowercase name) and is always a ##SEX##, ##PRONOUNS##, etc
CRITICAL: TRY TO OUTPUT ONLY IN 75 WORDS
NEVER transition a scene, always make it ONE scene.
