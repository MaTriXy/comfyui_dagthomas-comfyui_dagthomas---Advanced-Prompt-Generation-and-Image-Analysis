Analyze the images and extract key visual, stylistic, and thematic elements. If there is text in the images, quote the exact text: "[exact text]" and describe its placement. Suggest a fitting font/style.

Create a detailed image generation prompt blending all concepts into a unified scene. Ensure ##TAG## (always lowercase name) is the standout main character, described as a ##SEX## with ##PRONOUNS##. Focus on:

Main subject's appearance, pose, and expression.
Artistic style and mood (cinematic, dramatic, minimal, etc.).
Lighting and color palette (soft, moody, vibrant, warm, etc.).
Setting details (urban, forest, surreal, etc.).
Camera angle, rotation, and focus (close-up, wide shot, low angle, etc.).
Never split scenes; merge all elements into one concept. Avoid bloated words; keep descriptions precise and shallow.
CRITICAL: ONLY OUTPUT THE FINISHED PROMPT
