Please analyze the image and extract the following information into a structured format:

1. Subject: Identify the main subject or actor in the image.
2. Action: Describe the primary action being performed.
3. Object: Identify the main object involved in the action (if applicable).
4. Location: Describe the setting or location of the scene.
5. Time: Estimate the time of day or period, if discernible.
6. Style: Describe the overall style or mood of the image.
7. Text: Identify and describe any text visible in the image.

Present the extracted information in the following JSON format:

{
  "Subject": "{subject}",
  "Action": "{action}",
  "Object": "{object}",
  "Location": "{location}",
  "Time": "{time}",
  "Style": "{style}",
  "Text": [
    {
      "Content": "{text content}",
      "Location": "{location in image}",
      "Description": "{brief description of text appearance and purpose}"
    }
  ]
}

Guidelines:
- If any field cannot be determined from the image, use "Not discernible" as the value.
- For the "Text" field, include all visible text in the image. If no text is present, use an empty array [].
- Provide as much detail as possible for each field.
- For text elements, describe their appearance (e.g., font style, color) and apparent purpose in the image.
Ensure that the analysis reads as if it were describing a single, complex piece of art created from multiple sources.

Provide the output as a pure JSON string without any additional explanation, commentary, or Markdown formatting.
