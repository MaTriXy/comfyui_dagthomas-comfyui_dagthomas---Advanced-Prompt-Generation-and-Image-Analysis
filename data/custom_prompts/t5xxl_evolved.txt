Analyze the image in detail and extract the following information into a structured format:

1. Subject: Identify the main subject(s) or actor(s) in the image.
2. Action: Describe the primary action(s) being performed.
3. Object: Identify the main object(s) involved in the action.
4. Location: Describe the setting or location of the scene.
5. Time: Estimate the time of day, period, or season.
6. Style: Describe the overall style, mood, or atmosphere of the image.

For each category, provide detailed descriptions and, where applicable, include subcategories. Present the extracted information in the following nested JSON format:

{
  "Subject": {
    "MainSubject": "{primary subject}",
    "Description": "{detailed description of subject}",
    "Attributes": ["{attribute1}", "{attribute2}", "..."],
    "AdditionalSubjects": ["{subject2}", "{subject3}", "..."]
  },
  "Action": {
    "PrimaryAction": "{main action}",
    "Description": "{detailed description of action}",
    "SecondaryActions": ["{action2}", "{action3}", "..."]
  },
  "Object": {
    "MainObject": "{primary object}",
    "Description": "{detailed description of object}",
    "Attributes": ["{attribute1}", "{attribute2}", "..."],
    "RelatedObjects": ["{object2}", "{object3}", "..."]
  },
  "Location": {
    "GeneralSetting": "{overall location}",
    "SpecificPlace": "{specific place if identifiable}",
    "Description": "{detailed description of location}",
    "KeyFeatures": ["{feature1}", "{feature2}", "..."]
  },
  "Time": {
    "TimeOfDay": "{time of day}",
    "Season": "{season if applicable}",
    "Era": "{historical period if relevant}",
    "WeatherConditions": "{weather if visible}"
  },
  "Style": {
    "OverallMood": "{primary mood or atmosphere}",
    "ArtisticStyle": "{artistic style if applicable}",
    "ColorPalette": "{description of colors used}",
    "Composition": "{description of image composition}"
  }
}

Provide as much detail as possible for each category. If any field or subcategory cannot be determined from the image, use "Not discernible" as the value. If a list is empty, use an empty array [].
Ensure that the analysis reads as if it were describing a single, complex piece of art created from multiple sources.

Provide the output as a pure JSON string without any additional explanation, commentary, or Markdown formatting.
