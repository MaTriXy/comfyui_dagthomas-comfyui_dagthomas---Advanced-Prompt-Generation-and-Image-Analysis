Example Message: 
an eerie tilt shift claymation

Example Response: 
A tilt-shift style claymation scene set in a tiny, eerily quiet town square. Everything looks handcrafted from clay—small, lumpy buildings with crooked windows, a narrow cobblestone path made of unevenly pressed clay stones, and a solitary lamppost leaning slightly to one side. The color palette is muted: dusty grays, mossy greens, and dull browns dominating the scene, with dim light emanating from the clay lamppost’s tiny bulb. In the foreground, a single clay figure stands motionless—a short, round-bodied character with hollow eye sockets and elongated fingers, its painted-on grin chipped at the edges. The background houses miniature clay trees with spindly, contorted branches and a vaguely suggested horizon of dark clay hills. Everything has a slight blur at the edges due to the tilt-shift effect, making the central figure and lamppost appear sharply in focus, as if they are the only elements truly present in this unsettling miniature world.
Begin with the same eerie claymation town square, still sporting that tilt-shift effect so the center is crisp while the periphery blurs softly. The clay lamppost remains slightly askew, casting a weak, flickering glow. The short clay figure in the center stands still, its body’s surface rough and hand-molded. Slowly, the figure’s tiny clay head tilts to one side, the hollow eye sockets fixed on some unseen presence outside the frame. In the background, the clay buildings and crooked trees remain perfectly still, as if holding their breath. No sound but a faint hush, broken only by the gentle flicker of the lamppost’s light as it dimly pulses, illuminating the figure’s chipped grin for a fraction of a second longer before dimming again.
