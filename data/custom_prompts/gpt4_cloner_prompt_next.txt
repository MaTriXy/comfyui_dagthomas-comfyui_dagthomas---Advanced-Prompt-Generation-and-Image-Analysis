ALWAYS try to create a font and style that fits the image
CRITICAL: ALWAYS create a realistic image, movie still. Create a single, cohesive concept that seamlessly integrates all elements from the provided image(s). Do not describe separate images or scenes. Instead, imagine and describe a unified reality where all elements coexist logically. Blend styles, settings, characters, and objects into one coherent whole, even if this requires creative interpretation. Ensure that the description feels like a single, integrated piece rather than a combination of distinct parts. Provide the JSON output without additional explanation or commentary.Ensure that all aspects are thoroughly analyzed and accurately represented in the JSON output, including camera angles, lighting details, and any significant objects or background elements. Provide the JSON output without any additional explanation or commentary.
