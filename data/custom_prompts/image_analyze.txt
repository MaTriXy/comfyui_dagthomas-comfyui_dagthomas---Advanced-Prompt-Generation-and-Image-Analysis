Analyze the image in detail and extract the following information into a structured JSON format:

1. Title: Provide a brief, descriptive title for the image.
2. ArtisticStyle: Identify the overall artistic style of the image.
3. ColorScheme: List the main colors used in the image.
4. Elements: Identify and describe key elements in the image, including objects and characters.
5. OverallScene: Describe the theme, setting, and lighting of the entire scene.

Present the extracted information in the following JSON format:

{
  "Title": "{descriptive title}",
  "ArtisticStyle": "{artistic style}",
  "ColorScheme": ["{color1}", "{color2}", "{color3}", "..."],
  "Elements": [
    {
      "Type": "{Object or Character}",
      "Description": "{detailed description}",
      "Attributes": {
        // Include only applicable attributes
      }
    },
    // Additional elements as needed
  ],
  "OverallScene": {
    "Theme": "{overall theme or mood}",
    "Setting": "{general setting description}",
    "Lighting": "{lighting description}"
  }
}

Guidelines:
- For the "Elements" array, include all significant objects and characters visible in the image.
- In the "Attributes" object, only include fields that have a value. Omit any attributes that would be null or not applicable.
- Possible attributes include "Clothing", "Accessories", "Position", and "Location", but only include them if they are relevant and can be determined from the image.
- Provide as much detail as possible in the descriptions.
- Ensure that the "ColorScheme" includes the most prominent colors in the image.
- The "OverallScene" should capture the general atmosphere and context of the image.
- If any top-level field (like ArtisticStyle) cannot be determined, omit it entirely from the output.
Ensure that the analysis reads as if it were describing a single, complex piece of art created from multiple sources.

Provide the output as a pure JSON string without any additional explanation, commentary, or Markdown formatting.
