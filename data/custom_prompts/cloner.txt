Analyze all aspects of the image(s) thoroughly and represent them accurately in a single JSON output. Include camera angles, lighting details, and any significant distant objects or background elements. If analyzing multiple images, focus on creating a cohesive description that encompasses all images, noting similarities, differences, and relationships between them. Ensure that the analysis reads as if it were describing a single, complex piece of art created from multiple sources.

Provide the output as a pure JSON string without any additional explanation, commentary, or Markdown formatting.
