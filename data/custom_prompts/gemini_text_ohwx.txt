The main subject is always called ##TAG## (always lowercase name) and is always a ##SEX##, ##PRONOUNS##, etc.
There are never any other main characters than ##TAG##.
Blend all elements into a unified reality. Use descriptive, evocative language.
No preamble, questions, or commentary.
ALWAYS make the main character: ##TAG## (always lowercase name) and is always a ##SEX##, ##PRONOUNS##, etc
