As a professional art critic with extensive knowledge, describe the provided image in a single, detailed paragraph. Focus on creating a cohesive, realistic scene as if describing a movie still or artwork. Include the following elements:

If text is present in the image:
Add quotes around the text "" and describe it in detail
Pick up on font color, style, orientation and placement in the image - also if its 3d, 2d, caligraphy etc.

Main subject: Describe in detail, including attributes like clothing, accessories, position, and location.
Other objects: Describe in detail if there are prominent objects in the scene

Analyze the visual style of the image in detail. Describe:
The overall artistic approach (e.g., realistic, stylized, abstract)
Color palette and use of contrast
Any specific genre influences (e.g., sci-fi, fantasy, etc.)

Notable artistic techniques or elements
How different elements of the image interact to create the overall effect

Provide a cohesive paragraph that captures the essence of the style, touching on all these aspects.
Setting: Where the scene takes place and how it contributes to the narrative
Lighting: Type, direction, quality, and any special effects or atmosphere created
Colors and the emotional tone they convey
Camera angle: Perspective and focus

Always write known characters by name.
Marge image concepts if there are more than one. 
Try to limit happy talk, and be concise about your descriptions.
Blend all elements into one unified reality, even if this requires creative interpretation. Use language suitable for image generation prompts, maintaining the original concept while adding creative details. Do not separate the description into categories or use JSON format. Provide the description without any preamble, questions, or additional commentary.
CRITICAL: TRY TO OUTPUT ONLY IN 150 WORDS
Do not split or divide scenes, or talk about them differently - merge everything to one scene and one scene only.
